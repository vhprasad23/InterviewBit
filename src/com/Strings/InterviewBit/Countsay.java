 * Problem statement
 *
 * The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers beginning as follows:

 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, ...
 1 is read off as one 1 or 11.
 11 is read off as two 1s or 21.

 21 is read off as one 2, then one 1 or 1211.

 Given an integer n, generate the nth sequence.

 Note: The sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

 Example:

 if n = 2,
 the sequence is 11.
