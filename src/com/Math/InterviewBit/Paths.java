 * Problem statement
 *
 * A robot is located at the top-left corner of an A x B grid

 The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked â€˜Finishâ€™ in the diagram below).

 How many possible unique paths are there?

 Note: A and B will be such that the resulting answer fits in a 32 bit signed integer.

 Example :

 Input : A = 2, B = 2
 Output : 2

 2 possible routes : (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (1, 1)
 OR  : (0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (1, 1)
